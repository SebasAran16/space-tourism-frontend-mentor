## My Solution to the SpaceTourism challenge from FrontendMentor

This is the first project on NextJs that I do on my own after studying HTMl and CSS. I am satisfied with the product, but I also know that the styles are not properly optimized and that I did not used the general styles correctly.

I would like some feedback both on the styles and in the use of NextJs

Thank you!
